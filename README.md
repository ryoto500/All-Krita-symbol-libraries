# Krita-symbol-libraries
Symbol libraries for krita and inkscape 
Made from free vectors downloaded from across the internet, with explicit consent from the artist, open source licenses etc. 
Links to the artists websites are inbeded as vectors in the libraries themselves.
Some of the libraries were made by me from scratch.
this is an ongoing project. 
Some bugs, lagging or crashes may occur with the more complex vectors. I'm working on it. 
Most of the vectors are 4000x4000 px. This is because I encountered an issue where if the vectors are converted from their original size Their previews will be unidetifiable (among other issues) 
Tutorials on how to instal atc.: COMING SOON...
